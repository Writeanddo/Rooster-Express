**Rooster Express** is a game about a warehouse clerk alone with an increasing number of packages to organize. As the stressed little Panda, you'll have to classify a bunch of packages under the watchful eye of your boss. Be careful, as your space is limited and the flow of packages (and other items) keeps increasing every second.
