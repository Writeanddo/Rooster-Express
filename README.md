**Rooster Express** is a game about a warehouse clerk alone with an increasing number of packages to organize. As the stressed little Panda, you'll have to classify a bunch of packages under the watchful eye of your boss. Be careful, as your space is limited and the flow of packages (and other items) keeps increasing every second.

It was developed for **Ludum Dare 42**, "**Running out of space**".
